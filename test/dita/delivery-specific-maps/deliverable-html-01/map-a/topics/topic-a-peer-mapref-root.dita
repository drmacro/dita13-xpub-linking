  <title>Map A With Peer Mapref </title>
  <body>
    <p>This variant of Map A uses &lt;mapref scope="peer"/> to include the
      local-scope key definitions for map B. The intent is that references to
      these keys will be treated as peer references from the point of view of
      references within map A's local-scope resources (e.g., topic-a-01.dita),
      without requiring map A to duplicate those key definitions itself.</p>
