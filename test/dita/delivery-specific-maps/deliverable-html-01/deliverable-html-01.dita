  <title>Deliverable HTML 01</title>
  <body>
    <p>This deliverable represents the maps that will be used to generate the
      final HTML deliverable for Maps A and B.</p>
    <p>Both maps include the other map as a peer in the maps as authored. For
      the deliverable-specific maps, the peer map references are replaced with
      local-scope map references to maps that contain new versions of the key
      definitions from the included peer map, rewritten to reflect the locations
      of those resources <i>as delivered</i>.</p>
    <p>For example, the original key definition in Map B for topic
      topic-b-01.dita
      is:<codeblock>    &lt;keydef
      keys="topic-b-01"
      href="../topics/topic-b-01.dita"/></codeblock></p>
    <p>The rewritten keydef looks like
      this:<codeblock>    &lt;keydef
      keys="topic-b-01"
      href="../map-b/topics/topic-b-01.html"
      scope="external"
      format="html"
    /></codeblock></p>
    <p>Note that you can only know that the @href value should be once Map B has
      been rendered for this delivery. In practice this means that each map must
      be rendered twice: once to determine the output location of key defined
      for that map and once to reflect the deliverable-specific key definitions
      for each peer map.</p>
